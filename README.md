This is the first milestone for the project and contains a text based playable version of the game. The rest of the deliverables include the code (source + executable jar file), documentation (design decisions, java docs, and a user manual), and a UML and sequence diagram. The authors are Omar Elberougy, David Ou, Sudarsana Sandeep, Danish Butt, and Tharsan Sivathasan. One known issue is that in the game class some of the variables (for Fox/Rabbit/Mushroom) that are declared might not used depending on which challenge is being selected. This is because by default the class creates objects for the maximum number of possible foxes/rabbitâ€™s/mushrooms, but some challenges use a lower number of objects.
