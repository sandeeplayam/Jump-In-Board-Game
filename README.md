This is the first milestone for the project and contains a text based playable version of the game. The rest of the deliverables include the code (source + executable jar file), documentation (design decisions, java docs, user manual), and UML/sequence diagrams. The authors are Omar Elberougy, David Ou, Sudarsana Sandeep, Danish Butt, and Tharsan Sivathasan. One known issue is that in the game class some of the variables (for Fox/Rabbit/Mushroom) that are declared might not used depending on which challenge is being selected. This is because by default the class creates objects for the maximum number of possible foxes/rabbitâ€™s/mushrooms, but some challenges use a lower number of objects. Another issue we had was with the breakdown of the work. This is because there were 2 main parts to the code (the board class and the game/command words classes). Two people worked on those classes and the rest of the code/documentation was distrbuted between the remaining 3 people. This meant that the two people who worked on the board/game/command words classes contributed more to this milestone. In order to fix this issue, for the next milestone the 3 people who didn't code as much will code more and the other 2 will have less work to do. This will ensure that in terms of the full workload of the project the work is being distrubuted equally.
